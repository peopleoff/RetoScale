                        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is
                        encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock
                        icon

                        protect
                        your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job
                        (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
                        information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information
                        are
